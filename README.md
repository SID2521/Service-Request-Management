In my project, I create an interactive Power BI dashboard for service request management in Middle East cities, focusing on Saudi Arabia. This dashboard offers comprehensive insights into service requests, including categories, response times, resolution rates, and geographical distribution. Users can explore and analyze data to improve service efficiency and decision-making, ultimately enhancing the quality of services provided across Saudi Arabian cities.
